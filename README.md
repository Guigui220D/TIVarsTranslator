# TIVarsTranslator
A c# library to create and edit TI's calculators variables and files

I almost only used this documentation http://merthsoft.com/linkguide/ti83+/ as there's not a lot of them.
Please forgive the bad formulations in the token class, as I have not a lot of mathematic vocabulary, and i am not native english speaker
